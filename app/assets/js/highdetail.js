/**
 * highdetail.js — the "High-detail textures" feature set (issue #15).
 *
 * The Romanica texture pack ships in two layers: BASE (the plain pack the
 * server pushes on join) and EFFECTS (OptiFine-style features: connected
 * textures, random mob textures, animated textures, colormaps, custom
 * skies). The EFFECTS layer needs client mods to read those features, and
 * they cost memory and FPS, so the whole layer sits behind a launcher
 * setting that defaults to OFF.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth shared by the launch path
 * (processbuilder), the settings IPC (ipc.js) and the distribution tests:
 *
 *   - HIGH_DETAIL_MOD_IDS are the optional Fabric mods that read the
 *     EFFECTS features. When the setting is OFF they are force-excluded
 *     from the launch mod list, whatever the per-mod toggles in the Mods
 *     tab say (issue #15: "when off, they're left out of the mod list").
 *     When ON, the per-mod toggles rule, so players can still fine-tune.
 *   - BASE_PACK_MODULE_PREFIX / EFFECTS_PACK_MODULE_PREFIX identify the
 *     resource pack File modules in the distribution index, so the launch
 *     path can wire options.txt without hard-coding pack file names.
 *
 * Boundary (why this lives in the launcher): the server pushes the BASE
 * pack itself on join, and the in-game Romanica menu owns the same
 * preference while the game runs (RomanicaClient#28, writes the file the
 * launcher reads at the next launch). The launcher's half is exactly:
 * persist the preference, resolve the mods at launch, and manage the
 * resourcePacks entries in the instance's options.txt.
